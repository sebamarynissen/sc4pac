  description: >
    Four very simple lots using differently rotated street planter & bench props.
    Useful for gap filling in parks or among developed areas.

    Placing these plazas provides residential cap relief to the value of 1,000
    per lot per R-wealth category and raises commercial and residential
    desirability in the immediate vicinity.

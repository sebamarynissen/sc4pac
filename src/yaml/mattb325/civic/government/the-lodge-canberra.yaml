  description: >
    The Lodge is the official Canberra residence of the Australian Prime Minister.
    The building was constructed in 1927 in the Australian Georgian Revival Style.
    This a 6x6 reward lot which acts like the Mayor's House.  It will not override
    the default Mayor's House or any other Mayor's House.  Placing this lot will
    increase commercial and residential desirability needed to assist city growth.

  summary: "Vandamm House"
  description: >
    From the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock classic, North by Northwest, comes the
    fictional Vandamm House. It is so called, as it is the movie villain's
    (Phillip Vandamm) lair on the top of Mount Rushmore.

    This BAT is eye-catching and can be used as a Mayor's house in many
    different locations in your city: on steep mountains, overlooking ravines,
    over-hanging the in-game water oceans or rivers.
    This is a 1x1 non-conditional reward lot which acts as an extra Mayor's House.
    To enable the lot to be placed in remote locations, the building itself does
    not require either road access or power, but it does require water.

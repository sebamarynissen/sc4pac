  summary: "Karlsruhe Courthouse"
  description: >
    The district attorney's office in Karlsruhe is presented in SC4 as a
    functional courthouse.

    In addition to providing 128 civic jobs, it will help alleviate the
    commercial and residential demand caps by providing additional
    regional demand of over 80,000 CO§§ spaces and 10,000 Residential
    spaces. It sits on a 5x4 lot.  This is a non-conditional reward which
    does not override any other rewards.

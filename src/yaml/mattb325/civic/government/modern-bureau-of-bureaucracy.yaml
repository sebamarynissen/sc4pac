  summary: "Modern Bureau of Bureaucracy"
  description: >
    This modern Bureau of Bureaucracy is a fictional government building reached
    by a distinctive semi-circular sunken staircase. The design of the building
    is intended to be austere and intimidating. The building gouges through the
    landscape and forces anyone who seeks to enter to descend into the middle of
    government madness.

    This 6x6 lot is modded as a Bureau of Bureaucracy and is in the rewards menu.
    Like the in-game version this building provides civic jobs, and helps raise
    demand caps and mayor rating.

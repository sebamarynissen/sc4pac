  description: >
    This is a recreation of the Museu de Arte de SÃ£o Paulo on Paulista Avenue.
    It was built in 1968 and is an eye catching steel, concrete and glass
    structure which is supported by two red lateral reinforced concrete beams
    to provide over 70m of free standing, unencumbered space at street level.

    In game this operates as a large Museum in terms of jobs provided (167),
    student capacity (27,000) and radius (7,160).  It is found in the education
    menu.

  summary: "St Johns Church, Washington DC"
  description: >
    St John's Episcopal Church is a Greek Revival Building near the White House.
    It was built in 1816, and, owing its proximity to the white house, it has
    been frequented by nearly every president at least once, which has given
    rise to its common name of the 'Church of the Presidents'.

    The church sits on a 2x3 lot and is found in the reward menu. Placing this
    church will provide residential cap relief as well as boosting park,
    landmark and mayor ratings. It also provides 19 civic jobs.

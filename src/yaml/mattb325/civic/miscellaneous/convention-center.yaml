  summary: "Convention Center"
  description: >
    Though fictional, this building is inspired by some of the modern
    architecture of China which shows an amazing combination of self-assuredness,
    ebullience and seemingly gravity-defying engineering. Sitting on a 6x6 lot,
    this is a large building with the lower three floors alone providing almost
    8,000m2 of floor space per floor. At its highest point, the building is
    8 stories tall. There is also a combination of exhibition halls (including
    high-clearance spaces), conference rooms, cafeterias and indoor/outdoor spaces.
    The entire building is arranged around a pleasant, treed central courtyard.

    This BAT functions as a reward-lot and Convention Center in game. It provides
    154 civic jobs and will massively help alleviate the commercial demand caps
    that can hinder city development by giving an additional CAP relief of
    270,000 CO§§ and 270,000 CO§§§ jobs in the region.

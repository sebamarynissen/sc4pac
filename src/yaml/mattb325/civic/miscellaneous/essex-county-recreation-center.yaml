  summary: "Essex County Recreation Center"
  description: >
    This large building is based on a real arena in Essex County, New Jersey.
    It houses an ice-hockey and ice-skating arena with two NHL-sized rinks.
    It is lotted in such a way that it will blend in with KOSCs park series,
    but it will certainly work as a stand alone park.

    It sits on an 8x8 lot and is found in the park menu.
    In addition to providing healthy park and landmark effects, placing this
    building will also provide cap relief for R§ and R§§.

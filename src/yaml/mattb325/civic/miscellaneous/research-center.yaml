  description: >
    Alternative research center without the NIMBY effects of the in-game version.
    This research center does not generate radiation, reduce residential
    desirability, or lower your mayor rating.

    The Oran-Nayar-Blinn Research facility is a strikingly designed ultra-modern
    building situated on a leafy 7x7 campus-styled lot. It is just as suited to
    the middle of an industrial area as it is in a suburban or ex-urban space.

    In addition to providing many civic jobs, it will help alleviate the IHT
    demand caps that can hinder city development (by increasing IHT demand by
    130,000 places). It has also been modded to provide some residential and
    commercial cap relief by providing both Park and Landmark effects.

    It is offered as a non-conditional reward.

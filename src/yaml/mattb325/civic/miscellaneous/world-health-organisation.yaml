  summary: "World Health Organisation Geneva"
  description: >
    The nine-story WHO headquarters in Geneva were designed in 1959 by the Swiss
    architect Jean Tschumi. It is unashamedly modernist and quite graceful in
    its execution.

    The building is offered as a non-conditional reward and is a modified version
    of the advanced research centre. It does not generate radiation and it can
    easily be placed within a downtown environment or amongst parkland.

    In addition to providing your sims with many highly desirable civic jobs, it
    will help alleviate the IHT demand caps that can hinder city development
    (by increasing IHT demand by 300,000 places).  It has also been modded to
    provide some residential and commercial cap relief by providing both Park
    and Landmark effects.

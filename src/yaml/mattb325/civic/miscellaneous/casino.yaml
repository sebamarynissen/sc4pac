  summary: "Casino"
  description: >
    This casino is completely fictional and is modded such that it is a little
    less offensive to surrounding areas when placed (both visually and in terms
    of its modding) than the default casino.  At nine stories high, it is
    designed to fit into a mid-rise city scape.  It provides 410 civic jobs.

# TODO: The assets packaged above contain the temperate version of the lots. There are also tropical versions, but we are not yet sure how to implement such variants.

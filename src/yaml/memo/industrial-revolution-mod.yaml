info:
  summary: "Alter the appearance of all Maxis industrial lots (IRM base pack)"
  warning: >-
    With this mod installed, dirty industry (I-D) only grows on *medium*-density industrial zones,
    whereas high-tech industry (I-HT) only grows on *high*-density zones.
  description: >
    The IRM, an absolute masterpiece of a mod created by T Wrecks, redesigns
    all Maxis industrial Lots, giving them a complete overhaul and spicing them
    up with custom textures, props, and lighting.

    This package modifies the original mod by T Wrecks slightly by assigning new
    IDs to all the Lots in order to allow for seamless integration into existing
    regions. This way, it is not required to bulldoze any industrial Lots before
    installing this mod, but every newly growing industrial Lot will have the new
    style.

  # conflicts: ""  # No conflicts with CAM due to use of new IDs.
